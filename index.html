          C. J. Kerrick writes near-future, shadowed tales that walk through sorrow
          toward a quiet, unexpected hope. These are stories for readers who know
          that weeping may endure for a night, and yet wait for the morning.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Writing under the name <strong>C. J. Kerrick</strong>, the author explores worlds
          that feel just a few tomorrows away . . . places where technology hums in the background,
          grief lingers at the edges, and small, stubborn lights refuse to go out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than preaching from the page, these stories move by image and atmosphere:
          the hush of a dim-lit lab, a city that never quite sleeps, the ache of
          remembered hymns in a world that has forgotten their words.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work is shaped by lament, but not ruled by it. Every tale presses through
          the valley, looking toward a horizon that is not yet visible, but certain.

          The first major project is underway . . . a multi-volume, near-future epic
          that blends quiet horror, fragile beauty, and a thread of grace that never quite
          snaps.
